# MAB Jupyter Notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks to explain and visualize multi-armed bandit content in lectures, presentation, etc.

## Quick Instructions

The Jupyter notebooks can be open and executed in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) which provides an executable environment without installing anything. To use them:

1. Start the binder instance with all the jupyter notebooks by clicking on this badge [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/le-martin/mab-jupyter-notebooks/HEAD). This can take up to five minutes.
2. Move to the folder `notebooks`.
3. Open the desired notebook, for instance: `ucb1_visualizer.ipynb`
4. Execute the code and play around with the notebook! :)
